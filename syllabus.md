## Class Objectives:
  * To illustrate the practical use of various numbering systems and data representations
  * To introduce programming approaches and techniques appropriate at the hardware/software interface
  * To expose students to digital logic and computer engineering
  * To foreshadow salient material from Computational Theory (COMP310), Operating Systems (COMP322) and Compilers (COMP430) as it relates to computer architecture
  * To utilize various tools used within the COMP & CIT industry 

## Things to Note:
  * My goal is NOT to make this an easy class, but to maximize the amount of learning. 
  * I provide a lot information to provide context and to foreshadow material in future classes.  For this type of material:
    - Do not get overwhelmed with the information flow.
    - Do not focus on details but on concepts and relationships associated with this material.
  * The best way to be successful in this class is to be engaged!
  * The more you put into the class, the more you will benefit.
  * All class-related questions, comments, etc., are to be posted on Slack.

## Course Topics:
The class is broken down into four main sections. The following high-level topics will be reviewed, covered, or introduced within in four main sections:   

  * Models of Computations and Communications:              
    * Universal Computer, Turning Machine, etc. 
    * OSI and TCP/IP Communication Models
    * Instruction Set Architectures (CISC versus RISC)
    * Operating Systems and Execution Models
  
  * Encoding ad Mappings
    * Table Methods: e.g., ASCII, UTF-8, base64
    * Numbering Systems
    * Base Conversions
    * Binary Numbering Representations and mathematical operations
    * Floating Point Representation 

  * Boolean Logic
    * Combinatorial Circuits
    * Sequential Circuits
    * Pipeline Architectures

  * Introduction to Assembly Language
    * Three Address Code and Control Flow
    * Operational Semantics: Control Flow
    * MIPS Assemble Language
    * Parameter Passing: Registers, stacks, frames and buffers

## Course Evaluation:
The course evaluation for both COMP 122 and COMP 122L are unified. The instructor does not make a distinction between the lecture and lab meetings and utilizes the entire time as appropriate to cover the material and projects as necessary. Each student will be evaluated and will assigned the same letter grade for both COMP122 and COMP122L. This grade should reflect the quality and quantity of knowledge that the student acquired via this course. (It is all about learning!) 

Note that there is 15% percentage associated with participation. A student may demonstrate in various ways their involvement in the class. Through this involvement, I gain a better understanding of what you, and the class as a whole, has learned and what material needs to be reinforced or reviewed to strengthen the learning process.  

Students are expected to work diligently and consistently throughout the semester.  Students that procrastinate till the end in hopes that they can crunch and cram just prior to the submission deadline are sadly mistaken.

The table below provides the objective measures used to calculate a student's final grade. 

| Type | Weight |
|------|-------:|
| Participation, Exercises, Assignments, and Activities | 15% |
| Laboratory Assignments            | 40% |
| Quizzes (2)           | 15% |
| Exams (2) | 30% |


Regardless of the structure used to assign a quantitative number to each student, it is the Professor's goal to assign a final quantitative number that is closely aligned with the student's qualitative understanding of the course content. Your *active* participation in this class is central to demonstrating course knowledge.


## Teamwork and Collaborative Learning
I encourage everyone to work in teams, to engage in collaborative learning activities, and to discuss course material with your colleagues. The slack channel exists for class discussions.  I monitor the discussions to determine what information needs additional coverage in class, to correct any misinformation, and to provide pointers. Moreover, the class discussions are part of your "Participation" score.


###  Deliverables: Due Dates and Late Submission
All deliverables are enumerated in the "assignments.md" file within the class repository.  When an assignment is released and when it is graded, it is announced in class, and the "assignments.md" file is updated. The announcement might also be posted to the #fitzgerald-s23 channel. It is your responsibility to monitor the 

In this class, all deliverables are submitted via `git` (a Revision Control System). Students *must* make periodic updates to the deliverable's git repository.  That is to say, students must follow the standard software development process for both programming assignments and paper-like assignments.

Each deliverable has a defined "Due-date".  It is your responsibility to manage your time effectively to ensure your work is submitted correctly by the defined Due-date.  The Professor obtains a copy of your repository as it existed at that point in time.  It is this copy of your repository that is graded.

Any additional updates to your repository are considered late and will *not* be automatically graded. A student may request an accommodation for the Professor to grade additional information that exists in the repository as part of the grading process. If such a request is honored, which is at the discretion of the Professor, it is subject to a penalty.  Penalties increase based upon two factors:

  1. the amount of time passed since the assigned due date
  1. the frequency in which a student requests an accommodation for late submissions

To make such a late submission request, the student must:
  * must contact the professor via his Slack DM channel
  * must provide their github account name
  * must provide the assignment id
  * must provide a reason why the request should be honored.

Obviously such requests need to be made by the student as soon as possible. Note that no deliverable may be more than 7 calendar days late.


### Regrading Requests
Any student who believes that an error was made in grading on one of their assignment may request a regrade.  Such a regrade request *must* be made within 7 calendar days after the associated grade report has been provided.  

To make such a regrade request, the student must:
  * must contact the professor via his Slack DM channel
  * must provide their github account name
  * must provide the assignment id
  * must provide specific information about the error that was made 

Note that no regrade request made more than 7 calendar days will be honored.



### Makeup work or Extra Credit:
No makeup assignments are given to compensate for poor performance.  The pressure of work, academic workload from other classes, and scheduled extracurricular activities are not acceptable excuses for missing classes or for not submitting assignments on time.

##  Course Policies

## Recording of Class/Lecture Presentations
A student may freely record either class or lecture presentations. Such recordings, however, are for the individual use of the student or students currently enrolled in COMP122/L.  As such students may share their recordings with other students in the class, who have the same restrictions, but they may not otherwise post or disseminate said recordings.


## Teamwork and Collaborative Learning
As noted above---I encourage everyone to work in teams, to engage in collaborative learning activities, and to discuss course material with your colleagues.  The purpose of this is to enhance the learning process. 

Collaborative learning does not include the sharing of information that is included within a deliverable.  As such, all student deliverables must be the work of the student who has submitted the material. 

Students should therefore be familiar with the University's rules on academic dishonesty, which can at https://catalog.csun.edu/policies/academic-dishonesty/ Undergrad In particular, plagiarism will not be tolerated! Any student caught plagiarizing any work may automatically receive a grade of F for the course. If you are unsure as to what constitutes plagiarism, it is your responsibility to check with the instructor. Other forms of dishonesty will result in similar actions.


### Plagiarism and Academic Dishonesty

Grades are based upon the performance of individual students. This grade should reflect the quality and quantity of knowledge each student acquired via this course via an evaluation process. (It is all about learning!) 

Plagiarism and other acts of academic dishonesty interferes with the integrity 
of this evaluation and diminishes to overall educational quality of all students.   

Penalties for academic dishonesty may result in a grade of "F" for the entire course. Moreover, a report will be filled with the Computer Science department.  Students who violate this University policy are also subject to suspension and expulsion.

You should also be aware that intentionally or knowingly helping or attempting to help another to commit an act of academic dishonesty is in itself an act of academic dishonesty. For example, students who knowingly allowed another to copy their work during an examination is a violation of the Universities Academic Dishonesty Policy.
